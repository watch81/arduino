I wanted to create a code that would allow lady ada's motor shield to be used with a ky-023 analog joystick controller. 
The joystick has a x axis and a y axis. I only used the Y axis to move forward and backwards using the joystick. 
the x axis is not being used. i would like to use the x axis to control a servo for steering in the future. 
The joystick's resistance is 500 in the center, 1024 when pushed up and 0 when pushed down.
I wanted the motor value to be 255 when pushing the joystick to 1024 
"     "         "         "    255 "       "     "   "              0 and
" "       "     "     "     "    0 "     "     "           "      500
using some math i was able to create this effect. 
this will eventually be a building block to create a wireless RC car.
